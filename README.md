<h1>Mariah Eckrich's Web Development Portfolio</h1>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p> 
Welcome to my portfolio. As this is my first full website from scratch using HTML and CSS, I am very happy with how it turned out. This page is responsive using flex instead of media queries, which I later realized is the more challenging method. However I did learn quite a bit, and will focus much more time on planning out a project before I begin. All links are functional, and all images have alt attributes for accessibility.
